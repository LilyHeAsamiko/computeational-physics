1. To calculate things numerically is the newest thing I learned from the course. From derivatives, interpolations to integerations, the many methods are based on approximation with segmented grids. 
The software VESTA and FEnicCS are also new to me. The usage to edit and show crysal structure and solving equations are quite convenient. 
The calculation of gradient is also new to me, its application in, for instances, electron density calculation is quite impressive.'
2. I do think the subject will benefit my future endeavors. Because I chose my PhD field in neuroscience more related to dynamic modeling and computation. To think, model and solve problem computationally is really practiced thorugh this course.
And to program in python is also one of the main stream platform in my major, data engineering and machine learning.
3. The exercise later related to more physics is getting hard to me, but with the discussion with my classmate, I do feel I can still handle with it and I do not plan to give it up. Grade: 3
